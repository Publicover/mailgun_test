# README

See this app in action at fulltestsuite.herokuapp.com (give it a second to boot up). 

This portfolio app shows off a lot of Rails capabilities: it's mobile-first and responsive, it has parallax scrolling with a home-spun grid system, it's deployed on heroku, user accounts are handled by the devise gem, it can import and export CSVs, and it works with MailGun to send confirmation emails.
